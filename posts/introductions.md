Hey there! If you're spending any amount of time on this site then you must be driven by some sense of curiosity. Personally, curiosity has been the fuel of most of my interests: science, coding, Magic, activism, and so on. So if we are indeed kinfolk, it's great to meet you! Here's a little about me:

### BIO ###

I, Lee Gill, was born in Newark, NJ in 1991 but spent most of my young life in Rutherford, NJ. After graduating from Columbia University in 2013, I spent many years jumping from industry to industry for work all while exploring my creative side via writing. It was at the end of my first semester in a TV Writing Program at Stony Brook University in 2019 that I decided to drop everything and move to California. Two years of starting a life out West and watching it burn to a cinder brought me back to the East Coast in 2021.

My wanderings, although a bit dramatic, allowed me to collect a number of key insights about myself-- my pansexuality, my fluid gender identiy, my mentall illnesses, my healthy/unhealthy coping mechanisms.

And through the struggle of understanding and mastering myself, I've acquired numerous interests and talents that help me keep my balance:
