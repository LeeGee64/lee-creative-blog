This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## The Process

I was able to complete this site by following the Blog tutorial available from Next.js. The idea to focus the blog on thought exercises and mental health came from my own effort to develop better understanding of myself and the world around me. 

## Optimization

- *Content Diversification:* As my skills with React grow, I would like to include more complex content like custom videos or other graphics. This will be helpful to explain more abstract concepts like lateral thinking or transcendental meditation. 

- *Content Management System Integration:* To make article and entry creation easier, it would be good to include a CMS that integrates will with Next.

## Lessons Learned

- *Next.js Basics:* At the beginning of this project, I only had a basic grasp of React Native and no knowledge of any React frameworks. This blog was an excellent gateway into learning finer points of React as well as the ways Next.js manages content to improve UX. 

- *Vercel Hosting:* After learning Next.js, familiarizing myself with Vercel's deployment was my next step. Setting up the blog for production was easy, and I was especially impressed with how easy it was to track stages of development on the platform. This convenience convinced to me host all future projects on Vercel.
